# == Define: aptly::repo
#
# Create a repository using `aptly create`. It will not snapshot, or update the
# repository for you, because it will take a long time and it doesn't make sense
# to schedule these actions frequently in Puppet.
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*component*]
#   Specify which component to put the package in. This option will only works
#   for aptly version >= 0.5.0.
#
define aptly::repo(
  $component = '',
